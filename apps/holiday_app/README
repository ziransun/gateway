Assumption:

Gateway is up running. In our case, we have gateway
running at.
https://sosg.mozilla-iot.org/


In gateway code at  src/models/oauthclients.ts, we have CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET set in corresponding to
the settings in app_server.js. e.g.

" oauthClients.register(
   new ClientRegistry(new URL('http://127.0.0.1:31338/callback'), 'HollyHoliday',

                     'HolidayMaker OAuth Client', 'super secret', '/things:readwrite')
); "

Steps to set up the holiday app: 

1. Please replace the gateway address in app_server.js to your own. 

2. start auth server   node ./app_server.js
3. Go to http://localhost:31338
enter username & password 
username: holidaymaker
password: secret

press "Get Token" button

Once token is granted, you will be directed to the sensor access page. Have fun!
