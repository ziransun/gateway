Assumption:

Gateway is up running. In our case, we have gateway
running at.
https://sosg.mozilla-iot.org/


In gateway code at  src/models/oauthclients.ts, we have CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET set in corresponding to
the settings in app_server.js. e.g.

" oauthClients.register(
   new ClientRegistry(new URL('http://127.0.0.1:31338/callback'), 'HollyHoliday',

                     'HolidayMaker OAuth Client', 'super secret', '/things:readwrite')
); "

Steps to set up the holiday app: 

1. Install socket.io

npm install socket.io 

Then come to the home directory of Gateway, run

yarn

You might need to repeat above steps at your gateway server code as


2. Please replace the gateway address in app_server.js to your own. 

3. start auth server   node ./app_server.js
4. Go to http://localhost:31338
